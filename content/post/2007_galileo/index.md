Legend has it that around 1590, Galileo performed a now famous experiment. He dropped two canon-balls, one around half the weight of the other, at the same time from the leaning tower of Pisa. Both balls hit the ground simultaneously, showing that the speed of fall of an object is not proportional to its weight.

The significance of this result was two-fold: First it debunked the nearly 2000 year old theory of Aristotle (who was one of the greatest philosophers of all time and was taught at every university during Galileo’s day) which claimed that heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones. But more significantly, it showed that questions about the natural world can be answered decisively by experiment rather than only theorizing. Aristotle had believed that experiments were completely unnecessary and this view dominated during the time of Galileo. Thus Galileo’s experiment is often seen as being a key event in the discovery of the Scientific Method (which involves testing ones theories against Nature by experiment) by making people aware of the importance of experiment. *But did it*?

Galileo was motivated to perform the experiment by a stunningly simple and beautiful thought-experiment. He showed that the assumption that heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones leads to a contradiction.
 
His argument goes as follows:

Suppose we have two weights, $A$ and $B$, where B is twice the weight of A. Now let us assume that heavier bodies fall faster than lighter ones. This obviously implies that B should fall faster than A.

Now suppose we connect A and B together to form a single weight, C. (perhaps by gluing them together or something..) As B falls faster than A, we would expect A to slow down the fall of B. (as they are connected). Therefore the single weight C should fall slower than A alone would.

But the single weight C is heavier than either A or B, therefore by our hypothesis should fall faster than either A or B. Contradiction! Our assumption implies that C should both fall faster and slower than B alone would. Therefore our assumption must be false!  

Once he came upon this reasoning,  Galileo knew what the result of the dropping canon-ball experiment would be before actually doing any

experiments. What seems strange is that  this thought experiment seems to give us information about the world from nothing but logic. But is all as it seems?
