I really enjoyed Penrose's [The Road to Reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_Reality), and decided it would be fun (and educational) to do many of the problems in the book. Penrose promised that solutions would appear on the site [www.roadsolutions.ox.ac.uk](www.roadsolutions.ox.ac.uk), but this never happened. So I decided to write up my solutions in case they would be useful to others. 

The solutions are {{% staticref "pdf/PenroseSolutions.pdf" "newtab" %}}here{{% /staticref %}}.
