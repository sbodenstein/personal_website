title: "Building Smart Applications that Learn"
event: "SXSW"
event_url: "https://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP55442"
location: "Austin, United States"
summary:
abstract: "Creating a smart web or mobile application is much easier when you have access to state-of-the-art image, language, and machine learning functionality. We will demonstrate how to build powerful applications that can understand natural language, either from textual or audio sources, make use of computer vision functions, such as face and object recognition, and easily access external data sources. Finally, we will show how to use machine learning to create a self-learning application. This workshop will be interactive, with participants creating their own application and deploying it on the cloud, mainly using the Wolfram Language."
