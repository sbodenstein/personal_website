title: "Computer Vision and Applied Deep Learning with Mathematica"
event: "Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)"
event_url: "http://cvpr2016.thecvf.com/program/tutorials"
location: "Las Vegas, USA"
summary:
abstract: "This half-day tutorial is a hands-on introduction to using Mathematica and the Wolfram language for developing and deploying applications in computer vision and machine learning.  
Mathematica is a fully integrated system that spans all areas of technical computing. 
We will give a comprehensive overview of Mathematica's state of the art capabilities in computer vision and machine learning, including its completely new and integrated deep learning framework. 
You will be practicing hands-on with the Wolfram language through various application examples such as image retrieval, inpainting, feature extraction, or deep learning-based face detection."
